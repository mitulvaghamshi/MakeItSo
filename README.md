# Make it So

Building an Android app with Jetpack Compose and Firebase

The app we are going to build here is called Make It So. Itâ€™s a simple to-do list application that allows the user to add and edit to-do items, add flags, priorities and due dates, and mark the tasks as completed.

This is the first part of a series of articles that dive into creating a new Android application from scratch using Jetpack Compose for the user interface and some other tools offered by Google, like Firebase Authentication, Crashlytics, Cloud Firestore and Hilt.

## Using Firebase Emulators

```console
firebase emulators:start --import=path --export-on-exit=path
```

## Connecting Firebase Emulator to Android Emulator

`10.0.2.2` is the special IP address to connect to the `localhost`
or `127.0.0.1` of the host computer from an Android emulator.

```kotlin
FirebaseAuth.getInstance().useEmulator("10.0.2.2", 9099)
FirebaseStorage.getInstance().useEmulator("10.0.2.2", 9199)
FirebaseFunctions.getInstance().useEmulator("10.0.2.2", 5001)
FirebaseFirestore.getInstance().useEmulator("10.0.2.2", 8080)

// Disable cache
FirebaseFirestoreSettings settings = new FirebaseFirestoreSettings
    .Builder().setPersistenceEnabled(false).build()
FirebaseFirestore.getInstance().setFirestoreSettings(settings)
```

## Extras

```console
lsof -i tcp:port
kill [-15|-3|-9] port
```
